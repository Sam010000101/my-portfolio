# Responsive Portfolio Challenge

## Description 

As a web developer it is important to showcase your work in order to demonstrate your skills & talent to prospective clients and/or employers.

I have developed a portfolio page to showcase some of my early work as a front-end web developer. The portfolio will be considered a 'live' project that will be developed to include further examples of my completed works as I progress my career. 

I have learned and applied the following aspects as part of this HTML & CSS project;

<ul> 
    <li><strong>CSS Flexbox</strong> to provide a neat layout.</li> 
    <li><strong>Media queries</strong> to provide responsive content suitable for a typical phone screen with a max. width of 480px.</li>
    <li><strong>CSS variables</strong> to define specific values to be reused throughout the portfolio.</li>
</ul> 

I also applied my own color scheme and have added some hover effects on the nav bar as well as the grid images.


### Result - <br>

## Installation

N/A


## Usage 
The css variables that I have used in my project are included at the top of the style.css, changing these enables a quick change of color scheme to the whole of the page, which is more efficient than having to change each selector in turn;
